//! Runtime observability snapshot of EMAC traffic and DMA state.
//!
//! Gated behind the `instrumentation` feature. Builds without this
//! feature pay zero — every counter, timestamp, and histogram bucket
//! is gated.
//!
//! # What this module exposes
//!
//! - [`EmacInstrumentation`] — snapshot type holding per-token counters,
//!   sticky DMA-error accumulators, and IRQ→token latency histograms.
//! - [`EmacInstrumentation::snapshot`] / [`EmacInstrumentation::reset`]
//!   — consumer-side API operating on
//!   [`crate::embassy_net::EmacDriverState`].
//! - [`HISTOGRAM_BUCKETS`], [`HISTOGRAM_UPPER_US`], [`histogram_bucket`]
//!   — bucketing helpers so host-side analysers can reproduce the same
//!   shape.
//!
//! The actual increment logic — ISR-side and `Driver` token-consume
//! paths — lives in [`crate::embassy_net`] where the counters are
//! defined as fields of [`EmacDriverState`]. That module re-uses the
//! `now_us` and `IRQ_TIMESTAMP_NONE` items below through `pub(crate)`
//! visibility.
